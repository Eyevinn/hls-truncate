Node library to create an HLS by truncating the length of an HLS VOD.

## Installation

```
npm install --save @eyevinn/hls-truncate
```

## Usage

The code below shows an example on how an HLS VOD of 30 seconds can be truncated into a new VOD of approx 4 seconds.

```
const hlsVod = new HLSTruncateVod('http://testcontent.eyevinn.technology/slates/30seconds/playlist.m3u8', 4);
hlsVod.load()
.then(() => {
  const mediaManifest = hlsVod.getMediaManifest(4928000);
  console.log(mediaManifest);
});
```

What this library does can be illustrated by this simplified example below.

Consider the following:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment1_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment2_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment3_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment4_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment5_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment6_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment7_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment8_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment9_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment10_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

and with this library we can generate a new VOD by truncating to the nearest possible length (depending on segment length). Eg. for a target length of 5, this will result in:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment1_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment2_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

You can also provide a start-time offset.

```
const hlsVod = new HLSTruncateVod('http://testcontent.eyevinn.technology/slates/30seconds/playlist.m3u8', 4, { offset: 10 });
hlsVod.load()
.then(() => {
  const mediaManifest = hlsVod.getMediaManifest(4928000);
  console.log(mediaManifest);
});
```

The library will first remove 10 seconds (approx depending on segment length) and then take the next 4 seconds of the original playlist. For example consider this playlist:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment1_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment2_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment3_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment4_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment5_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment6_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment7_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment8_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment9_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment10_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

will result in:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:3
#EXT-X-ALLOW-CACHE:YES
#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD
#EXT-X-VERSION:3
#EXT-X-INDEPENDENT-SEGMENTS
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment5_0_av.ts
#EXTINF:3.000,
segment6_0_av.ts
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

It will remove 12 seconds from the start (3 segments is 9 seconds and 4 segments is 12 seconds) and then truncate the remaining part to get a duration of 6 seconds (2 segments i 6 segments which is close to 4 seconds as requested).
